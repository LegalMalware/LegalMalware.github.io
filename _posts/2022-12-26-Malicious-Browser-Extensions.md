Browser extensions are small software programs that can be installed on a web browser and add additional functionality or features to the browser. They are designed to enhance the user’s experience and make it easier to browse the web. However, just like any other software, browser extensions can be used for malicious purposes.

For example, Malicious browser extensions can collect and send sensitive information to third parties. This can include login credentials, financial information, and personal data. This data collection and tracking is often done without the user’s knowledge or consent.

Another way malicious browser extensions can be used is by altering the default search engine or injecting ads and other unwanted content into websites. This can include pop-ups, banners, and links to other websites. These ads and content can be annoying and disruptive for the user, often leading to phishing attacks or other scams.

To reduce risk, only install extensions from trusted sources, such as the official extension store for your browser. These extensions have been assessed for malicious intent; however, these checks are imperfect. It is also recommended to carefully read the reviews and descriptions of extensions before installing them. Pay attention to any red flags, such as many negative reviews or a lack of information about the extension’s purpose or functionality.

Additionally, regularly update your web browser and keep your operating system and antivirus software up to date. This can help to protect against security vulnerabilities that may be exploited by malicious extensions.

It is also a good idea to periodically review the extensions installed on your browser and remove any that are no longer needed or that you do not recognize. This can help to reduce the risk of being targeted by malicious extensions.

Ultimately, browser extensions can be a useful tool for enhancing the user’s online experience, but they can also be used for malicious purposes. Therefore, it is essential to be cautious when installing and using extensions and to take steps to protect against malicious extensions. For organizations, it is recommended to disable browser-based developer modes and browser extensions and enable extensions using an allow list if necessary.
