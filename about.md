Legal Malware Labs is a business focused on studying and analyzing computer viruses, worms, and other malicious software (malware). Our team of malware researchers is dedicated to identifying new threats, understanding their behavior and capabilities, and developing techniques to detect and defend against them. In addition to this, we also create custom malware for red team and penetration testing purposes, helping businesses and organizations test the effectiveness of their cybersecurity defenses.

We use a combination of technical skills and critical thinking to reverse engineer malware samples, understand how they work, and figure out how to stop them. We also collaborate with other researchers and security professionals to share information and insights, and to stay up to date on the latest threats and defense strategies.

In addition to our technical work, we also communicate our findings to a wider audience through presentations, articles, and other forms of outreach. Our goal is not only to protect against existing threats, but also to educate others on how to stay safe online and prevent future attacks. At Legal Malware Labs, we are committed to helping businesses and individuals protect their systems and networks from harm, both through our research and through our custom malware development services.
